<h4>Hello There</h4>

I am a junior full-stack developer from Brazil.

I have experience only with personal and university projects, which totalize 3 years of development experience. Each day that passes, I improve my skills more and more, and one day I will achieve the **DREAM** ðŸ™Œ

Besides that, I love games, RPGs, psychology, philosophy, mangas, musicâ€¦ The list goes onâ€¦ Anyway, I try to improve myself a little every day, as a developer and as a person. And for now, I am searching for a place where I can demonstrate my skills at a professional level.
